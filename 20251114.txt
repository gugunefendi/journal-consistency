I don't want high expectation, I just want do these in one weeks or seven days.

The First.
I must learn how to write correctly and properly in English.

So, how to write correctly and properly in English?
Yes! I must know:
1. Basic Grammar
  - Simple present -> untuk kebiasaan
  example: I go to office every day
  - Simple past -> untuk kejadian masa lalu
  exmaple: I visited my friend yesterday
  - Simple future -> untuk rencana
  example: I will learn English tomorrow
  - To be (am, is, are / was, were)
  - Subject-verb Agreement (I / you / we / they / He / She / it)

2. Vocabulary
  - Daily activities (eat, go, work, sleep)
  - Family
  - Job / Work
  - Feelings
  - Places
  - Time

3. Write a Sentence
If I have already with grammar and vocabulary, lets start to write a sentence.
Subject + verb + object + (information)
exmaple:
 - I drink orange juice in the morning
 - She works at a bank
 - We study English every night

4. Write a Short Paragraph
Start with 3-5 sentence:
Basic Structure:
 - Topic sentence (kalimat utama)
 - Supporting sentence (penjelasan)
 - Closing sentence (penutup)
Example:
My daily routine is simple.  I wake up at 4 a.m. Then I take a shower and eat breakfast. After that, I go to work. I always try to start with a positive mind.

5. Learn Connectors (Kata Penghubung)
To make youre English so more natural.
  - and, but, or
  - then, after that, next
  - because, so
  - first, second, finally

6. Practice make perfect
Start with:
  - 3 sentences about todays activities
  - Description of nearby objects
